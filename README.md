this is my first ludum dare. not my first time game programming, started a few years back using flash.

i had no illusion about the scope, i planned for a large scale mmo rpg fps rts with integrated chat.

lol just joking, i knew from the start i wouldn't be able to implement more then 2-3 game mechanics.
not to talk about a few levels,graphics,or a minimal ui.

the goal was only to stretch my wings and have a feel for a 48 hours deadline. i planned for as minimal as i can.
no graphics no ui,barely a logo start and game over screen,3 sounds, and a little soundtrack(failed here).
for the meat i chose a defence game ,as minimal as possible. 3-4 classes. no more then a prototype.

the main tool was my own html5 dom based game engine.
i noticed a few things i can refine in my engine. but all around its a simple tool perfect for prototyping.  
also used jquery.

for the sound i used:

for the logo:
photoshop and my graphic design teacher free designs.

<b>how to play:</b>
the rectangle that follows the mouse is the player. 
the white rectangles are bases,all the other rectangles will try to reach and destroy them.
it takes time to destroy a base even if the enemy is touching them.

each base spawns a color powerup every few seconds, to destroy red you need a red power up and hover on red.
to destroy blue get the blue powerup and hover blue etc.

when you hover red with red powerup it explodes after 3 seconds,blue shrinks and green gets sliced.

there is no goal or points yet i didnt get to that part of the game and wanted to keep the scope as small as possible.
